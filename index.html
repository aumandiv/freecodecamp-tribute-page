		    <ul>
		      <li><b>EARLY LIFE</b> -<em> Garbage collector</em><br> Domagoso is the only child of Joaquin Domagoso (a stevedore at Manila's North Harbor) and Rosario Moreno (from Allen, Northern Samar)
                 He found alternative sources of income at the age of 10 by pushing a cart and going house-to-house to gather old newspapers and used bottles, then reselling them at a local junk dealer. He also rummaged through restaurant garbage bins for leftover food, which his mother would recook for dinner</li><br>
		      <li><b>SHOWBIZ LIFE</b> -<em> Movie Actor</em><br>In 1993, at a wake in Tondo that Isko attended for free snacks, his good looks caught the attention of talent manager Wowie Roxas. Wowie then encouraged Isko to join show business. He first appeared on TV as one of the aspiring teenage actors in German Moreno's variety show "That's Entertainment"(1986)</li>
		          <br>
		      <li><b>POLITICAL LIFE</b> -<em> City Mayor</em>Moreno started his political career when he elected and sworn as councilor for Manilaâ€™s first congressional district in 1998 and reelected in 2001 and 2004 respectively.
                 In 2007, he later became vice mayor of the city. He took a crash course in Local Legislation and Local Finance at University of the Philippines. He then studied public administration in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (University of the City of Manila) while fulfilling his alderman duties.
                 On May 13, 2019, Isko Domagoso Moreno won the mayoralty of Manila via a landslide win of close to 150,000 votes more than the closest contender. Mayor Moreno was then officially proclaimed winner by the City Board of Canvassers the following day, 14 May.
                 he served as a former three-term councilor of the city's first congressional district from 1998 to 2007 and more recently as the Vice Mayor of Manila from 2007 to 2016.</li>
